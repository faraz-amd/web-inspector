The framework leverages Playwright for browser automation and integrates other tools and libraries to provide a comprehensive testing solution.

In addition, the framework includes a **Web Health Inspector** — a lightweight web auditing tool built with Playwright and Express, designed to analyze web page performance and accessibility with an easy-to-use frontend.
